# EcoTrek

This web application is aimed at addressing the pressing need for sustainable travel and to promote a greener future. The application aims to ensure that users can make more informed and environmentally conscious decisions when traveling, and reduce their overall carbon footprint. Our application helps to track carbon footprint and incentivize Singaporeans to engage in eco-friendly initiatives, with an attractive reward system. With the looming issue of climate change, this project seeks to raise awareness and highlight the importance and significance of every individualâ€™s action and impact.
